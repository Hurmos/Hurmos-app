## TL;DR
A sports matchmaking system using players' online calendars.

## Introduction
The goal is to provide a league game experience for racket sports and stick games (badminton, tennis, basketball, football, ice hockey) with 2-22 players using private and public sports resources.

Hurmos uses a user's calendar connected to the app-backend to suggest sport game matches at nearby sports resources using users' favorite sports and skill level at empty calendar slots. Matchmaking works by using the pool of other players available at the times the user could play, the user's distance from the nearest sports resources, and skill level.

For sports facility owners, it provides the possibility to list their resources to be used in the matchmaking. It suggests matches for players at these sports facilities using real-time resource information. Accepted matches result in billing the player's cut of the sport-field rent, and afterwards, funds will be transferred to the resource owner.

The app generates revenue only through a 10% fee added to the sport-field reservation fee paid by players. Additionally, the app provides a free reservation system for resource owners. This system allows reception employees to input reservations made via phone or in-person, linking them to the app for resource-specific reservation time data.
