# Hurmos-app

## tldr
A sport matchmaking system using players online-calendars. 

## introduction
The goal is to provide a league game experience for racket sports and stick games (badminton, tennis, basketball, football, ice hockey) with 2-22 players using private and public sport-resources.

Hurmos uses user-calendar connected to the app-backend, to suggest sport-game matches at nearby sport-resources using users favorite sports, and skill level, at empty calendar slots. Matchmaking works by using the pool of other players available at the times the user could play, the user distance from nearest sport-resources and skill level. 

For sport-facility owner it provides possiblity to list their resources to be used in the matchmaking. It suggests matches for players at these sport-facilities using real-time resource information. Accepted matches results billing the players cut of the sport-field rent, and afterwards funds will be transferred to the resource owner.

The app generates revenue only through a 10% fee added to the sport-field reservation fee paid by players. Additionally, the app provides a free reservation system for resource owners. This system allows reception employees to input reservations made via phone or in-person, linking them to the app for resource-specific reservation time data.
